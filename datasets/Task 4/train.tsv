Told the dr I thought I might need a flu test. He brought up the coronavirus test with me but we both agreed that it was alarmist and premature to take it. Took a flu and strep test both negative	1

1234658935472214019	140449519	@Perednia I agree.  Considering his age, his recent heart surgery, and his close contacts with thousands of people across the country, he’s very susceptible to the Coronavirus. I’m not a doctor, but I think he’s pushing the envelope in regards to his health.	0
